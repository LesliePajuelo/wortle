### Features & Design

- React for frontend build.
- Bulma.io CSS framework + custom CSS (responsive design).
- [PokéApi](https://pokeapi.co/) for Pokémon data
- User statistics, badge achievements, and daily game state persist in either local storage or a database depending on whether a user signs up for an account.
- Firebase for optional user authentication and database to prevent user data from being lost if/when browser memory is cleared.
- [react-i18next](https://react.i18next.com/) internationalization framework used to manage multiple language translations.

#### Gameplay

- Guess the mystery Pokémon in 6 tries.
- Each guess must be a valid Gen 1 Pokémon.
- After each guess, you are provided with feedback to show how close your guess is to the mystery Pokémon.
- Instead of feedback on spelling like in Wordle, you get feedback based on your guess's Type, Evolution Tree, Attack, Defense, Height, and Weight relative to the mystery Pokémon.
- The mystery Pokémon will attack you after each guess, giving you an additional clue as to who it is.
- There are 3 difficulty modes. For example, Gym Leader mode disables the mystery Pokémon attacks.
- Your stats are shown and you can share your results, like in Wordle. When you share results, a random Trainer quote is included from Red/Blue (e.g, "Hi! I like shorts! They're comfy and easy to wear!" -Youngster).
- There is a Safari Zone where you can play unlimited Wortle, but your activity doesn't contribute to your stats.

### TODOS

- [x] add firebase user authentication and cloud firestore option to prevent users from losing data when browser memory is cleared.
- [x] add react router
- [x] make default difficulty mode harder. Consider filtering attacks unique to one Pokémon and/or only attacking on certain guesses.
- [x] refactor code for react-18next and add Spanish.
- [x] clean up mobile response issues for Spanish (share button too large on spanish mobile).
- [ ] refactor some useEffects into functions
- [ ] add error message for case where user inputs the same guess twice in a row.
- [ ] implement better user experience for input field focus on mobile.
